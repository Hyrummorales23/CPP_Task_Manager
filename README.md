# C++ Task Manager

## Overview

This is a console-based To-Do List Manager application written in C++. It demonstrates professional C++ programming practices including object-oriented design, STL containers, and file I/O operations. The application allows users to manage tasks with full CRUD functionality and persistent storage.

As a software developer, I created this project to strengthen my C++ fundamentals and showcase my ability to build practical, well-structured applications. This project highlights my understanding of modern C++ practices and software engineering principles.
